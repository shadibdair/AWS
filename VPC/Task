Your job is to create a new secure network for your workplace.

Notes:
  - We are not going to use the AWS provided VPC, SG, Route table etc....

1. Create a new VPC
  Q: Provide two best practices when creating a VPN
2. Create a new subnet
3. Create a route table
  Q: Can you sniff a packet between instances in AWS?
	Q: What is the implied router and how is it different from route table?
	Q: How many ENI should I attach to my instances if my instance is in between zones?
4. Associate the subnet with the route table
5. Create an EC2 machine in the new subnet and connect to it. Try to ping 8.8.8.8, explain what are you missing?
6. Create the missing 2 pieces to be able to ping the internet.
7. Q: What is the benefit of using a NAT gateway instead of Internet Gateway?
8. Create another EC2 in the same subnet, can you ping the first machine? If not, create and specify what is missing.

Today's lecture:
	1. SG vs ACLs
	2. S3 ACLs
	3. Costs in creating resources in different AZs
	4. VPC peering & Endpoints

Bonus:
  You have the following issue:
	Your company is creating and destoying machines automatically everyday. You heard from the developrs that some of the machines do not communicate well with the others.
	How would you solve this? (AWS has a solution for this, think cloudwatch....)
